In the video I show you the codes only I have been working on which I put comments to show you what each does 
also I tried to show you the Nokia snake game demo containing:
(Concept of game is to get the highest score without hitting the wall and the body of the player results in game over and score goes 0
eventually the player would go game over since the body would be so large there wont be any free space)

1) Game over menu.
2) Resume/pause. 
3) Self damage.
4) How snake eats apple 
5) At the last I also shows you the main menu. 
6) Also game use swipe gesture.
